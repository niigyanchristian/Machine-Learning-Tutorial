    "1. Regression Analysis: \n",
    " technique used for predicting a continuous outcome variable (also called the dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (also called independent variables or features).   \n",
    " - The goal is to  find the relationship between the input variables and the target variable, allowing us to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    " Types\\\n",
    " **a. Linear Regression:** One of the easiest and most popular algorithms. shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (x) variables.\\\n",
    "    i. Simple Linear Regression\\\n",
    "    ii. Multiple Linear Regression\\\n",
    "**b. Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "**c. Logistic Regression:**\n",

    "To predict the categorical values, we need Classification algorithms.\n",
    "They are used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data, classifies into groups or classes Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cancer or no cancer etc.\n",
    "- Binary Classifier: If the classification problem has only two possible outcomes, then it is called as Binary Classifier.\n",
    "Examples: YES or NO,\n",
    "- Multi-class Classifier: If a classification problem has more than two outcomes, then it is called as Multi-class Classifier.\n",
    "TYPES OF ML CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS:\n",
    "1. Linear models\n",
